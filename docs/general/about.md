## About  

This started off as a python3 update to CrackMapExec.  
As I was converting, several issues came up due to dependancies that I ended up changing a bit of how things work.
  
Not all modules have been carried over yet and this is still a work in progress.  
Feel free to open issues, I know of a few (usually due to target OS compatibility)  
but will still use the issue log to track/address.  

Same cme feels, just a bit different under-the-hood.

Second, wowz omg to the guys over at [SecureAuthCorp](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r) for impacket.   
Notably [asolino](https://github.com/asolino) and [dirkjanm](https://github.com/dirkjanm)  
CMX is merely a wrapper around all their awesomeness (this version at least ;)
